# dev-test-python

The dev-test-python is mostly about your creation. The goal is one - solve the maze in the most optimal way, with a solution that
won't be the one-of-the-top listed by Google search :-) It's about the programming, not the internet search :-)

## Prerequisites

The ``maze`` folder contains 4 sample mazes. Your task is to create an algorithm, that:

* will solve the maze,
* draw the solution over the maze,
* store the solution in the file 

## Evaluation

We gonna check your solution against multiple other mazes. Our evaluation base on:

1. completeness (image load, maze solution, solution output)
2. effectiveness (% of solved mazes)
3. time (shorter is better as can be expected)
4. coding style, creativity level,
5. generalization level 


## Keep in mind

1. Use Python only (v3+)
2. share the solution over the github with clear instructions in README.md file
